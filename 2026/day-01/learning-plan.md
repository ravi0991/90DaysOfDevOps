# 90 Days DevOps Learning Plan

## Current Level
Working professional (Linux System Administrator with 3+ years of experience in server management, networking, and troubleshooting).

## My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud
DevOps is a culture and engineering practice that combines development and operations to enable faster, reliable, and automated software delivery using CI/CD, containers, infrastructure as code, and monitoring.
Cloud engineering involves designing, deploying, and managing scalable infrastructure and services on platforms like AWS to support modern applications.

## Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud
I want to transition from system administration to modern DevOps and Cloud engineering roles where automation, scalability, and continuous delivery are essential.
This course will help me:
- Stay relevant in modern infrastructure practices
- Increase career growth and salary potential
- Work on scalable cloud-native systems

## Where I Want to Reach in 90 Days
In the next 90 days, I want to become capable of building and deploying a complete DevOps pipeline and cloud-native application environment independently.

## My 3 Goals for the Next 90 Days
1. Deploy a containerized application on Kubernetes (EKS or local cluster)
2. Build an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins
3. Provision cloud infrastructure using Terraform on AWS

## 3 Core DevOps Skills I Will Build
1. Containers & Kubernetes troubleshooting
2. CI/CD pipeline design and automation
3. Cloud infrastructure provisioning (AWS + Terraform)

## Weekly Time Commitment
Weekdays: 2 hours daily (Mon–Fri)
Weekends: 5 hours (Sat or Sun)
Total Weekly Learning Time: ~15 hours

## How I Will Stay Consistent
